## About

**Problem Statement** - Our country holds a huge share of agricultural production for vegetables and fruits globally, but the fruit business has seen a steep rise in the success rate, especially since the pandemic outbreak more and more people are becoming health conscious, they are prompted to distance themselves from a diet full of fat and sugar. As a result to maintain a healthy lifestyle the fruit service business will help thousands of individuals to meet their dietary requirements. 

**Suggested Solution** - Vineyard Growers is a responsive web application which helps customers improve their health conditions by having easy access to fresh fruits. It will also provide an updated list of items available with their updated price in the shop to help the customers in checking the availability of the needed items at that very day in order to save their time.
